ChatterBot, a Python library designed to make it easy to create software that can engage in conversation.

ChatterBot’s training process involves loading example dialog into the chat bot’s database. This either creates or builds upon the graph data structure that represents the sets of known statements and responses. When a chat bot trainer is provided with a data set, it creates the necessary entries in the chat bot’s knowledge graph so that the statement inputs and responses are correctly represented.
